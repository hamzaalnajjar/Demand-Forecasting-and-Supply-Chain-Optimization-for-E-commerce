## Introduction

This report outlines the analysis performed on the e-commerce sales data, focusing on demand forecasting and supply chain optimization.

## Demand Forecasting

We used both classical time-series models using ARIMA and machine learning models like Random Forest to predict future demand.

## Optimization Model

We developed a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model to optimize inventory levels and minimize supply chain costs.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how data science can drive decision-making in an e-commerce supply chain context.
